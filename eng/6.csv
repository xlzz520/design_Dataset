3,The first thing that comes to mind is probably the fitness aspect.,基于功能的分析,2
4,"I'm not going to say that I'm not going to do it because a lot of young people are doing it now, and they're going to do it.",基于功能的先例,3
5,"Some outdoor fitness facilities may be used when the weather is hot or cold. The elderly are not very comfortable and the elderly are not very comfortable to travel, so it may be a fitness robot",基于功能的分析,4
6,"The functional module, first of all, needs to have a ≪timing ≫.",概念合成-功能,5
7,"And then, the companion definitely needs one, a big screen.",概念合成-结构,5
8,The video is also a great way to get a feel for the physical activity.,概念合成-功能,7
9,The body is not too tired during exercise.,基于功能的评估,8
10,"The whole product needs to be round and comfortable, so the impact is taken into account.",概念合成-结构,5
11,The product is simple and easy to use for middle-aged and elderly people.,概念合成-结构,5
12,"Then the size of the robot, I consider it a gym companion, the overall size, the proportional size ratio, is it close to the size of at least one landing fan?",概念合成-结构,5
13,"The timer function can then be displayed on a rounded, circular screen.",概念合成-结构,6;7;10
14,"Then it has some buttons that are relatively simple to operate. It is suitable for middle-aged and older people to use something easy to operate, such as starting a workout or ending a workout or taking a break.",概念合成-结构,11
15,Then the voice module is definitely to be added. The elderly he may.,基于功能的分析,5
16,Then the whole robot. It may be rounded on top. It may be conical on the bottom.,概念合成-结构,10
17,The middle ⇒ adds one ⇒ tilted over ⇒ can place some ⇒ function buttons ⇒ screen buttons ⇒ visualization ⇒ movement visualization ⇒,概念合成-结构,16;8;14
