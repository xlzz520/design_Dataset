5,The overall style of the building is rather lovely and rounded.,概念合成-结构,2

13,The difference is a little bit bigger than the first one.,基于结构的评估,12;1
14,A desktop word is probably about the size of a speaker.,概念合成-结构,13
15,And this is probably a little bit like what you see in a smart home speaker today.,基于功能的分析,14
16,"Because of its shape, it's better to carry it around.",概念合成-结构,15
17,I feel like he can actually play a better accompaniment function than a cell phone or something.,基于功能的评估,16;15
18,"It's also possible to add remote audio, which makes it easier to make video calls with your kids or friends your age.",概念合成-功能,17
19,It also has a life-minder feature.,概念合成-功能,17
20,The product should be basically available.,基于功能的评估,19
21,"The new technology will also include a number of features, such as a smart medicine box.",概念合成-功能,17
22,"And because it's so portable and so small, you can combine that with a little bit of functionality.",基于功能的评估,21;16
23,"And then the third option, which is that it looks like a kind of cute companion robot.",概念合成-结构,1
24,It's like the stuffed toy that kids love.,基于结构的先例,23
25,So it may not feel like the two robots before it.,基于结构的评估,24;12;2
26,"I'm going to be able to do a little bit of that, a little bit of that, a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that, and then a little bit of that.",基于结构的分析,25
27,"For example, a design toy can be shaped like a toy.",概念合成-结构,26
28,"It's probably the middle of the two, the middle of the volume.",概念合成-结构,27;12;2
29,Its functional aspects can be combined with its physical features to produce some functions.,基于功能的分析,28
30,"For example, you can communicate in real time.",概念合成-功能,29
31,The oldest person in the world likes to listen to radio or drama and is given it in the form of audio.,概念合成-功能,29
32,And then the life-reminder function is also important.,概念合成-功能,29;19
33,"And the fourth thing is, in terms of appearance, I think I can make a miniature robot.",概念合成-结构,1
34,And then you have the watch type.,基于结构的先例,33
35,"The word ""snap"" is used to describe the way a person looks at a person, and the way they look at a person.",基于结构的评估,34
36,The new watch will be a bit different from the current smartwatch in terms of functionality.,基于功能的分析,35
37,"Because now kids will have little genius watches, but I don't know if older people will have similar products.",基于功能的先例,36
38,"The older smartwatch, the more simple the interaction.",概念合成-行为,37
39,"The problem is that older people are not so good at using their phones, and using them is a bit difficult.",基于行为的评估,38
40,"The watch, which reminds you of your life, is also important.",概念合成-功能,39;19
41,"This watch is also portable, as it is when you go out, whereas the previous watches were only portable at home.",概念合成-结构,41;23;12;2
42,"I feel like it's mostly about looking at the watch, what functions it integrates.",基于功能的分析,41
43,"For example, if you are going out, you can add something to help you know where to go, which makes it a little safer for you if you are going out by yourself.",概念合成-功能,42
44,Navigation is also available.,概念合成-功能,42
