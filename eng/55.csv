1,"I'll start by taking users into consideration, because there may be multiple options involved.",基于功能的分析,0
2,"In fact, it's related to the user's characteristics, like he's a healthy companion, and if you combine that with that, it's like middle-aged people are more likely to be healthy, and they have some potential needs, like health advice, health advice.",基于功能的分析,0;1
3,"For the elderly, it is a state of health first of all. Like middle age, there may be some hygiene or a pursuit of health, and then it may not be a state of particular health, for example, he is ill, a state in need of help in life.",基于功能的分析,1
4,The second is health companionship. I can also break it down into a very direct way or an indirect way. Like a crutch or a wheelchair is a more direct way. Like indirect words.,基于功能的先例,2
5,"Robot is a nickname, so to say that it has a shape does not necessarily mean that it will actually look like a human, maybe it is a form problem; then it needs to be different from the current product.",基于结构的分析,0
6,"Based on the first user, say a middle-aged person, who may need some health advice or need some health guidance function, a form of icon-based",基于功能的分析,2
7,"In fact, he's middle-aged, his learning ability, including his cognitive level, is comparable to that of a teenager, so I think his behavior is kind of like a software interaction.",基于行为的分析,6
8,"Because it's an assist, not physically like a crutch wheelchair, its structure I don't think is particularly limited.",基于结构的分析,7
9,"It needs to carry a software function, so how can you tell the difference from a phone?",基于功能的分析,8
10,"The scene in the kitchen, food is closely related to health and also there is a strong correlation",基于功能的分析,6
11,"For example, make a recommendation for a healthy recipe on your refrigerator and include the calorie sugar of the food in your refrigerator. For example, a user who has asthma may prefer to eat less oily fish or less seafood.",概念合成-功能,10
12,"I also had an idea about the rhythm of life. This scene might be the bedroom scene, for example, and I think it might be more like a stage lamp.",基于功能的分析,6
13,"First, it may have a function similar to an alarm clock, but it tends to combine a light, resulting in a light, and then a more gentle way of waking up. Second, it may actually have some sound functions.",概念合成-功能,12
14,"The idea of a person who is older than the average person is not the same as that of a middle-aged person. The idea of an older person is that he is not in a stable rhythm of life, but that he needs someone to guide him.",基于功能的分析,3
15,"The middle-aged person, he is actually cognitively stronger, including his ability to interact with software is stronger, but the older person, he may be an identifier for this screen, including its low acceptance of software, so I may still be inclined to do a more hardware product hardware.",基于行为的先例,14
16,"So if you say sub-healthy, then I'll do an indirect form, and the needle is just for a group of people that aren't particularly healthy, I might be more inclined to do a direct form.",基于行为的分析,14
17,Health companionship: I may sit at the table for example. Because I know something about older people. I know something about their food choices.,基于功能的先例,4
18,"Or too much of a single, including food that may not have been eaten and it's been repeatedly stored, can be ingested.",基于行为的先例,17
19,"For example, at the table. There will be a small robot, including a camera. The form of the small robot is not necessarily the form of a robot, but it can be integrated into the environment.",概念合成-结构,5;18
20,"For the elderly, these products are still relatively exclusive. For example, I can make a bouquet of flowers. Put it on the table. It will be more integrated. Or, for example, a small table lamp, also a form of a small table lamp, will have a camera to scan the food on the table if it is nutritionally balanced.",概念合成-结构,19
21,"Or, for example, a dish he ate for three days. He would remind him not to eat it, or some vegetables he ate in the evening and he could not eat them the next day, or some suggestions on preservation.",概念合成-行为,20
22,"And then this is indirect, because the advice to take a pill is to combine it with drinking water.",概念合成-功能,21
23,The user's behavior is actually more likely to be in the way of listening to the voice.,概念合成-行为,22
24,"The book is written in a way that is structured, integrated into the context, and then does not need to be read. It is also better to have a conversation with him, and some simple conversations.",概念合成-结构,20
25,"The direct direction is that it is not a healthy state, it may be in need of help.",基于行为的分析,16
26,"For example, the main thing about the elderly is that their legs and feet are not very comfortable.",基于功能的先例,25
27,"People have a need to travel, especially older people who often go to the grocery store, so I think this behavior can be integrated into the scene where they go to the grocery store.",基于行为的分析,26
28,"The word ""shop"" is actually very much related to this scene, it requires a small cart.",基于功能的分析,27
29,It's also structurally integrated into the trolley.,概念合成-结构,28
30,"And then the specific behavior that I analyzed, the scene that he was in, actually had a little bit of a connection to the one that just happened at the table.",基于行为的分析,27
31,"He wants to buy the dishes, the combination of the dishes.",基于行为的分析,30
32,The other problem with the action I just mentioned is that it can provide a boost to the economy.,概念合成-功能,27
33,"It's not that I can sit like a wheelchair, move like an electric car, but I don't think that's necessary.",基于功能的评估,32
34,The elderly he needs a stable structure that can support,基于功能的分析,30
35,The idea of a shopping cart is similar to a supermarket cart. It actually puts the food in front of the cart.,基于结构的先例,34
36,"If it were a supermarket cart, it would be too big and impossible to move.",基于结构的评估,35
37,Shopping cart miniature,概念合成-结构,36
38,"There is a problem with that, including buying a dish. He needs to calculate his weight. He needs to calculate its price.",概念合成-功能,27
