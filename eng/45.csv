1,"And I think that, unlike new products, the first impression of existing robots is that they are the kind of machines that are going to be used to make new products.",基于结构的先例,0
2,"You can imagine it could be something more than just a material like this, it could be like a puppy or a toy bear, and the shape would be softer because it would be a little bit more flexible.",基于结构的分析,1
3,"It's nice to have a theme that accompanies it, so it can be softer in shape and material.",概念合成-结构,2
4,"The health point needs to be monitored, so it should be somewhere you can touch.",基于行为的分析,0
5,"It could be that there are some health issues that older people need to be concerned about, that it could be some things that can be measured.",基于功能的分析,4
6,"And if you're going to touch a puppy or hold a toy, any of these things that you're going to do in your daily life, you can monitor it right here.",概念合成-结构,5
7,"If you touch a puppy's head, for example, you might have something on its head that's like a sensor to monitor something that we need to measure.",概念合成-结构,6
8,"It allows this robot to do something like health monitoring in a relatively unconscious way, and it can do it at any time of day, without having to remember to do it.",基于功能的评估,7
9,He's a small product in life and not always remembered it's probably this health monitoring is something that needs to be done on a long term basis that's stable periodically to do,基于功能的评估,7;8
10,So it needs to have some kind of reminder function.,基于功能的分析,9
11,"It can make a small expression or make a sound effect to remind you that you can touch me today, you can hold me.",概念合成-功能,10
12,"If you're an elderly person in your home, and you need something like this to monitor your health, your child, one of your younger family members, will buy it.",基于功能的分析,4
13,"So on the family side you'll also need to be able to receive some of the information data, and each measurement can be done there like on a mobile phone. This can also be done at some point, and each measurement is transmitted and recorded.",概念合成-功能,12
14,"The presentation of the date will be a logical presentation. There will be a historical record, so that you can observe its overall health fluctuations and so on.",概念合成-功能,13
15,"Then if it's more interesting, this side can also be a small product. For example, a small bulb, or even a small flashlight, something that shows dynamic behavior, a product that can give feedback based on the elderly person's health condition, such as if he once measured normal, his heart rate is normal, blood pressure is healthy, that is, it is a healthy state. For example, if it is a bulb shape, it will light a soft light representing health.",概念合成-行为,14
16,"A weaker interaction, it would have an accompanying nature to be emphasized. I don't go to a cold-cold phone to see how he is to record how he is, but every day I come home, sit on the couch, and see this on the wall telling me in real time that my mom or dad or grandma is in such a health condition. Dreams, it's always a soft light, I can be reassured to know that when he's doing well today, so, then I find out that he starts to have some flashing light, such a weak interaction, because it's probably not a measure of some very urgent disease.",基于行为的评估,15
17,"If you walk a little on a horse, it may not be because the technology is mature enough, but it may be that the health companion can be a little exaggerated, a little fancy, for example, it can be done when traveling.",基于结构的分析,1
18,"For example, a common elderly person would have a small crutch, and the crutch would have that hand to hold it in, so it was almost always monitoring it, and could monitor it as long as it walked down the street.",概念合成-功能,17
19,"It has some other functional value attached. For example, its normal crutch itself supports it, and then it may have something like a guide, a reminder, etc.",概念合成-功能,18
20,"It might be a little bit like a blind guide dog, which is that it can always be in my hands to help me get my day-to-day life going, but it will have all kinds of different forms of functions that come together, so it also has the nature of a companion, and then it's always monitoring me.",基于功能的评估,19
21,"A healthy robot is not just something that's shaped like a person or an animal, but something that's more convenient to use in everyday life.",基于结构的评估,19;20
22,"It's a kind of a metaphor that is being made with the Internet of Things now, and all kinds of smart home renovations, a little bit of a hotel project or a young person's home, maybe he can do that and he can be able to regulate it normally through the elves, the little ones, the schoolmates.",基于功能的先例,21
23,"But if we were to do a smart home renovation with the elderly as the theme, this central control is what we would use now.",概念合成-功能,22
24,"Then he has all these things that help him live. What we need is the convenience he brings, and what the elderly need is probably some more help on top of convenience.",概念合成-功能,23
25,"It can also be healthy, like a toilet in a bathroom. Everything can be controlled and linked to monitor all aspects of it.",概念合成-功能,24
26,"By judging what his excrement is, his health is monitored by a robot that can monitor his health, and then there's his water machine, etc. that can be seen on his face, he says, if he's drinking enough water today. Including but not limited to all of these, it can use a variety of devices that are smart throughout the house to record all of its health data invisibly, and then through this centrally controlled robot, it can also help him to operate these contents at the same time.",概念合成-功能,25
27,"First it was a toy bear we made on the couch! It was made of fluffy material, it looked like a normal thing, and then it had all kinds of built-in monitors, chest sensors, and then it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a",概念合成-结构,2
28,And then you can have a user-side content.,概念合成-结构,27
29,"Weak interaction products, first if it is a small bulb, small wall lights because they may be separated from the two places their own old people themselves live, young people in the big city and live on their own, then it can be a wall lamp, then it is weak light soft light. Bright soft light represents his health is not to worry, he is well today.",概念合成-功能,15
30,"If accompanied, this little bear can be a small monitoring, it can be placed on the couch can go to see what kind of life he is, today there is safe to stay at home no accidental situation, he can also have some voice and radio place is completely his five senses.",概念合成-功能,29
31,"The word crutch is a little subtle and a little unimaginable, first it might be a crutch, but not the usual crutch shape, it might be a crutch with three horns.",概念合成-结构,18
32,"First of all, the cue is that he will have some common destination cue, like the old man's house, which park he might go to often, and then he will come home to the supermarket, so a few points are very easy to choose, and the sound is a reminder that it could be a child's voice.",概念合成-功能,31
33,"He's always holding onto something, and then he puts these sensors in there to monitor it, and then he can measure it in real time, and then record the abnormalities that are happening to remind the child of that.",概念合成-功能,32
34,What else can be added to the little bit of useful functionality that the crutches can add to the carrier?,基于功能的分析,33
35,It can control the entire house link and control.,概念合成-功能,23;34
36,"It might make it a little bit weaker in form, not like the existence of this strong entity, which it might be particularly weak in the kind of healthy monitoring, like it's just a regular square thing on a teapot.",概念合成-结构,1
37,He might have something on it like a humidity temperature sensor that monitors the temperature in the house and makes some reminders about how to adjust it.,概念合成-功能,36
38,It doesn't make sense.,基于功能的评估,37
39,"I think of something that might be funny, and it just popped into my head from a Marvel movie, the little bouquet, because many older people grow some flowery plants at home, a bunch of flowers, a pot of flowers or a tree.",基于功能的先例,1
40,"He's one of those plant-like things, but he has something that's very human-like and intelligent, and he's a very intelligent being.",概念合成-结构,39
41,"It would be nice if every time a few elderly people would go to water the flowering trees around him for their daily care, it would be okay to interact with the plant, especially the plant, like touching its branches.",概念合成-功能,40
42,"Then it is a very soft thing in itself. The shape of the house is just a plant, developing its own body and so on, and it will have some beautiful states, and it will be very soft.",概念合成-结构,40;41
43,"And then this state can be a companion point, which is to present to him that you're happy now, or some kind of response, like the elderly person looks happy now, and he might be even happier, and the companion response is to tell him that he has this plant that's been watching him.",概念合成-功能,42
