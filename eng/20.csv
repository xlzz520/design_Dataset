38,"The separation can be done if necessary, and a robot can be sent to clean up the area once.",概念合成-结构,37
39,Maybe I wondered if it would have some game-like capability to make the elderly as happy as possible and keep their bodies healthy.,基于功能的分析,4;29;34;38
40,And I'm not really feeling like a feelingless robot.,基于功能的评估,39

42,It's possible to put some tasks or some games in the form of a game to make their lives more interesting.,基于功能的分析,41
43,"The only thing that's going to be possible for a while is maybe some connection and communication with your children, and maybe some kind of a relationship with your parents.",基于功能的分析,4;34
44,"For example, if he can give some data to his children, this product should be available.",基于功能的分析,43
45,"And then some of the classifications, say some of the mediums that they need, like the speech aspect might be one, two, three, mostly one, two, three.",基于行为的分析,6;7;44
46,"If it's something physical, it could be 4, 5, 7, 11.",基于行为的分析,14;20;25;34;45

49,Sleep detection may require some wearable device to support it,基于结构的分析,27;48
50,"And then look at the input and output, and the input is actually mostly some of the voice and behavioral data of the elderly.",基于行为的分析,0
51,"The output may have, say, a voice segment as a notification, and then there may be some physical behavior.",基于行为的分析,44;45;50
52,"Visual notifications, because some things are not intuitive enough to be written or spoken, may be more intuitive to be expressed with images.",基于行为的评估,51
53,"Option one, it feels hard to write this companion robot, but maybe the first option is a scenario that might be remote, without considering the outdoors.",基于行为的分析,0
54,"If it's a home scene, I think the form can be a little bit more human-like, mainly to meet some of the needs that are underneath the home scene.",基于结构的分析,53
55,"Its base, or rather the whole shape, is somewhat like that of a puppet, but its base is a more like a robot-sweeper.",概念合成-结构,54
56,"The word ""popular"" is probably more appropriate at home.",基于结构的分析,55
57,And the older people are actually more realistic about what's more like something.,基于结构的分析,56
58,"If it's just a form of something that's cold, it might not have that kind of emotional accompaniment.",基于结构的评估,57
59,"It has some possibly humanoid structures, and older people are also able to interact with it more easily.",基于结构的评估,55;56;57;58
60,"It can be used to teach older people to do things like exercise or health monitoring, and it can be used to teach older people to do things like that in a human way.",概念合成-行为,59
61,"Or, you know, I feel like it's designed to look a little bit like a child, so it's kind of scary.",基于结构的评估,59
62,"Option two, maybe I'll consider a healthcare companion robot for middle-aged people who might be outdoors, and I feel like I'm still in the home scene.",基于功能的分析,0;25;61
63,"Maybe option two, I think it's more about health.",基于功能的分析,62
64,"Because option one is probably more geared towards a life-support robot that's all-powerful, and maybe not as prominent in terms of health.",基于功能的评估,54;63
65,"If it's going to be something more prominent in health, I feel it will require some integration of existing medical equipment.",概念合成-功能,64
66,"And then there are things like blood pressure, blood pressure readings.",基于功能的先例,65
67,"There may be some other physical examination instruments that are currently being used, and if they can be combined into a robot form, it's possible that they could be used to test the body.",概念合成-结构,66
68,"It can do some physical examinations, or health tests, quickly with a robot like this.",概念合成-功能,67
69,"I'm not sure what this format is supposed to be, because now the physical exam is probably still a person-based exam, and there's not a lot of equipment.",基于结构的分析,68
70,Some devices are hard to fit into the size of a robot.,基于结构的评估,69
71,"The last option, if you think about it, is the big white shape, which is the same as the white shape.",概念合成-结构,0
72,"Because it feels like the elderly person is probably sitting a lot of the time, and he's sitting in this position and he's most exposed to the chair and the sofa.",基于行为的分析,71

74,"I've seen a lot of these, a lot of these larger devices at design shows, and there's a feeling that you can't help but lie in.",基于结构的先例,73
75,"Maybe if he was in a more relaxed state, which is the robot, the total area of contact would be bigger.",基于结构的分析,74
