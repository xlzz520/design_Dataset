2,The main thing is to have a class and some psychology.,基于功能的分析,1
3,The feeling that the elderly are more friendly than many people in a nursing home who have cats and dogs is a comparatively friendly image.,基于结构的先例,2
4,"And then it behaves not just like an animal, it might be able to make a human voice, and it could be able to make a human voice.",基于行为的分析,3
5,"For example, remind him to be careful with his feet when he is at home. Sometimes it is safe to go down stairs or to use a ladder to the kitchen door.",概念合成-功能,4
