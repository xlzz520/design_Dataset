37,"The transparency will be a little higher, the older people may be in the operation; it may be easier to understand.",基于行为的评估,31;36
38,"Then the color, you can also consider, because the old people, it is used to accompany, is it possible to color slightly, not necessarily just some black and white gray, this experience what a technological feeling.",基于结构的分析,29
