1,"I'm going to go with a common idea that I'm going to have, and I'm going to start by locating this population and then I'm going to say middle-aged people and then I'm going to divide it further into, because not all middle-aged people, maybe they need companion robots, so why would this type of middle-aged people need them?",基于功能的分析,0
2,"He is most likely an empty nest elder, or a state of two elderly people living alone, without accompanying children.",基于功能的先例,1
3,"When he's not with his kids, he might need this robot to help him with some health management or some spiritual guidance.",基于功能的分析,2
4,And then they can use it as a channel to communicate with their children.,基于功能的分析,2;3
5,"On the other hand, it can also be used as a tool for the elderly, helping them to deal with some of the everyday messes.",基于功能的分析,4
6,The first thing I'm going to do is design a healthcare robot for the elderly.,基于功能的分析,3
7,Functional points can help older people perform a function of timely reminder to take medication,概念合成-功能,6
8,It can help the elderly to store some medicines in a walking medicine box; it can then automatically help the elderly to distribute medicines,概念合成-功能,7
9,"The elderly can put their daily medication into a box that the robot stores, and then set up a number of related things, such as how many medications to take per day, and the robot can help them with the daily distribution.",概念合成-行为,8
10,"For example, the amount of medication that a person needs to take, it can automatically extract from different medications and then directly fit it into the elderly.",概念合成-功能,9
11,"But one problem that can arise here is that the difficulty of the operation is relatively high, and the way the setup is done may not be very skilled.",基于行为的评估,9;10
12,"On the one hand, the elderly can operate some mechanical buttons.",概念合成-结构,11
13,"Meanwhile, his children can monitor the elderly from the cloud via a mobile app and remotely help the elderly to set up their diet and medication routines and then remotely help them to conduct a health management.",概念合成-功能,1
14,"And in terms of behavior, there may not be much innovation in that behavior, because after all, the drug-eating robot is not a very innovative product in itself.",基于行为的分析,6
15,"I could think of something more innovative, which is that it can automatically deliver medication and then automatically alert the patient to the medication.",概念合成-行为,10;14
16,"He may have a little bit of a pet-like shape, but he carries a different grid of drugs on his body.",概念合成-结构,15
17,"And then when he goes to give the elderly medicine, he'll automatically, maybe on the robot's wrist, or he'll have a special area underneath which there's some indicator lights.",概念合成-结构,16
18,"For example, if you need to take a medication, it can give you a voice message.",概念合成-行为,17
19,"I actually had me before, and I had this thought that if this robot is very humanoid, it can be like a real child.",基于结构的分析,16
20,"But it also seems possible that this formulation, on the one hand, is a mechanical structure that is more than that, and then it is not very suitable for a set of such a conventional robot product.",基于结构的分析,19
21,"On the other hand, it's possible that older people might be more resistant to this kind of purely mechanized stuff.",基于结构的分析,19
22,Don't make the robot too mechanical. Then there can be some comparison of the cartoon image and then be a little more friendly.,概念合成-结构,21
23,"This box it could be a fixed window. Then let the old man just form a coherent memory every time he goes to take his medicine, he will always know that he needs to take his medicine here.",概念合成-结构,22
24,"He can certainly help with some of the regulation, like this daily health class.",基于功能的分析,6;7
25,It may be more inclined to have a holistic health management of the body of the elderly.,基于功能的分析,3
26,"This robot, which is not just a robot for indoor use, it can also follow the elderly in some outdoor activities.",概念合成-功能,25
27,"It's a whole image of a relatively small entity, which may be as small as a cell phone.",概念合成-结构,26
28,"The elderly need to carry such a relatively portable product with them, and then at home it can also be. It can be placed in a fixed position, and then outdoors you can take part of it, and then make a relatively deformed existence.",概念合成-行为,27
29,"The function of the indoor and outdoor can be different, with a daily diet for the elderly in the house; monitoring; and then monitoring if their diet is in line with the rules.",概念合成-功能,28
30,"And at the same time, one of his dietary habits is uploaded to this cloud, and there's a doctor who manages his health remotely, or maybe his children, to do a monitoring.",概念合成-功能,29
31,The elderly can also be monitored for outdoor activity.,概念合成-功能,29
32,"He can monitor the elderly when necessary, which is a fall prevention function.",概念合成-功能,31
33,These are also the old-fashioned features.,基于功能的评估,32
34,The data on daily dietary health and exercise management will be uploaded and the precise diagnosis made by a remote doctor.,概念合成-功能,33
35,"So this could be a relatively healthy elderly person who just needs some dietary management, exercise management, but there could be a lot of elderly people who have some kidney disease, like diabetes or high blood pressure, who can upload their health data to this health management robot and then form a support management with them.",基于功能的分析,34
36,"This behavior, I can understand it as, on the one hand, the behavior of the elderly, and on the other hand, the behavior of this product.",基于行为的分析,0
37,"Then the elderly person may be indoors and put it in a more fixed position to do it, it is a bit like a camera, it can do some sort of checking, some kind of indoor monitoring.",概念合成-行为,36
38,"If you take it outdoors, you can put it in your pocket or attach it to your electronic devices or button it on your clothes so you can carry it outdoors.",概念合成-行为,37
39,"It's a little bit like that watch, the shape of the button, it doesn't have to be very noticeable.",概念合成-结构,28;38
40,"And then when he goes out, this robot will remind him whether he should choose to go out by himself or give him a reminder.",概念合成-行为,38
41,"The first two are more important than this kind of health management. Then the third one, which I probably would prefer him to have.",基于功能的分析,6;26
42,"And one of the things that's important here is to go with these two words, because actually there's not a lot of innovation in health management, because there are a lot of similar products out there, like drug management, or health, or blood pressure, or blood sugar management, and there are a lot of products that are probably already being done, and are more mature.",基于功能的分析,41
43,"And then mental management, which I think is something that older people need to be more concerned about, because a lot of older people who have just retired, are not very mentally able to accept that they're in a relatively clear state, and then they have a relatively anxious state, which is very common.",基于功能的先例,41
44,"But they may have many different ways of relieving anxiety in the elderly, from different channels.",基于功能的先例,43
45,"It can be from the fact that a person's mental health, he may have a different access to a channel, on the one hand, is derived from the elderly person's own a link to mental health, on the other hand, he can get from external channels to some spiritual link, to establish some intimate relationship some people, his partner, or say his children to some healthy, mental link.",基于功能的先例,44
46,"Then, based on your own words, you can help the elderly person develop some personal interests and hobbies. For example, if the elderly person likes to sing or dance, the robot can accompany him to perform some related activities.",概念合成-功能,45
47,The elderly and their families can be helped to establish a connection between their relatives,概念合成-功能,45
48,"For example, a partner or child can synchronize with the mental health of the elderly, and robots can automatically plan for them.",概念合成-功能,47
49,"For example, tell your child that your mother is in a lonely, anxious state, and then remind them to go and often care for the old man.",概念合成-行为,48
50,"For the elderly, they will have their own social circle, he will have some friends besides family, and then, for example, former colleagues, neighbors, etc. They will often have some social activities, and they will be able to talk to each other.",基于功能的先例,45
51,"But maybe these social activities are not as close as they are for young people, but older people can often get a lot of spiritual support from these activities.",基于行为的分析,50
52,It can help older people practice building something similar to a circle of friends.,概念合成-功能,51
53,"Then help the elderly person focus on some other friends who are better off with him, some of their life situations, and then let them do a mutual motivation",概念合成-行为,52
54,"And then formally, it's a little bit like a small-screen smart Titan or something like that.",概念合成-结构,53
55,"And then it doesn't need to have this kind of movable function, which is relatively fixed.",概念合成-结构,41
56,"It's a little bit like the kind of intelligent assistant we use most of the time, which is you can have a conversation with him and communicate with him.",概念合成-行为,55
