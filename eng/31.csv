1,"If it was a health robot for the elderly, I might have thought, well, I know a little bit more than I do, or maybe the point of entry I can think of is chronic diseases in the elderly.",基于功能的分析,0
2,"Perhaps because chronic illness may already be a serious threat to his health, but not a rapidly developing disease, then and there management of this part is also quite accompanied.",基于功能的先例,1
3,"That function is the needle for the chronic disease management part that I just mentioned, and that can be said, well, including his mental health, which may actually be a part, I'll think about what aspects first.",基于功能的分析,2
4,"This part of chronic disease management, it has its daily monitoring symptoms first; monitoring, then statistics of kidney statistics; then maybe including his what-ifs; then maybe including some risk predictions; maybe taking medication reminders; maybe if the injury is functional, these are the ones I can think of right now; maybe.",概念合成-功能,3
5,"And then if he says that this is the chronic disease management part, he can also go to the ─ oh, it's either the community hospital ─ or the online doctor. ─ Oh, it can be a ─ connection, or a ─ no connection, what's that called, it's a kind of a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a",概念合成-功能,3
6,"And then there are the people that he can contact, including his children, because even if it's an escort, he can't replace that part of the child's escort, he can act as a link between him and the child's escort.",概念合成-行为,5
7,"Well, this section may also be about some of the things that you, the elderly, are aware of. The middle-aged person or the user's attitude. Well, he may be concerned about his privacy and may not want to let his children know about his privacy.",基于行为的分析,6
8,"It's okay, well, what you're sending, or whether you're sending, is probably to ask the user's opinion, but here, it's really about who the user is, and what the user is doing.",概念合成-行为,7
9,"Because if the middle-aged person is the user of the robot, then it is very likely that the buyer and the user are the same. Well, he is two groups of people, the buyer, probably the elderly, there may be such a situation.",基于功能的分析,6;8
10,"If I say that this side of the world, ""Oh, he'll put more emphasis on his privacy protection"", some elderly people may either not want to let their children worry, or they may be afraid to protect their own privacy, so there can be a mechanism, his sending mechanism.",概念合成-行为,8
11,"In this part of the world, there may be a lot of people involved, one of them is our buyers, one of them is the users. There are also people. There may be more people involved in healthcare. There may be more people involved in healthcare. There may be more people involved in healthcare. There may be more people involved in healthcare.",概念合成-功能,5
12,"And then think about it again, if you go back to the robot, well, well, well, well, well. The robot, his sensory organ, the robot. If you want to achieve this kind of disease management function, you might need some auxiliary equipment.",基于结构的分析,4
13,The robot is then used as a secondary controller.,概念合成-结构,12
14,"This side is this as these might be these assistive devices, the pump, carried on the user's body, and then this monitored these indicators, and then that robot here might be... but so what is its meaning as a robot?",概念合成-结构,13
15,"What's the difference between sending a mobile phone software and sending it to a mobile phone? Maybe it's. Yeah, he doesn't know the difference between mobile phone software. Just think about where he might be referring to.",基于结构的评估,14
16,"In fact, if it were just to achieve this function of managing chronic disease, well, I don't think it's a bit necessary for robots at the moment, but if it's with mental health behind it, then it's included, well. I don't know what specific professional term or what term that is meant to mean, it's like the first time in the elderly.",基于功能的评估,14;15
17,The main thing here is to focus on his emotional needs.,基于功能的分析,16
18,The first is that the robot itself is a party to this interaction. The conversation is recorded. The robot can record his daily habits. The robot can help him. The robot can remind him.,概念合成-行为,17
19,"Then maybe it could also be used as a... no-brain... present... song... mother... child.. or.. parent.. some communication.. because I have a brain before, this is something I have seen before... a design that is a bit unthinkable, but probably...",基于行为的先例,18;6
20,"And then this? That's probably because, if I'm wrong, this is probably because, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, there's some stored voice, etc., and it's not there right now.",基于功能的先例,19
21,"The child enters some words, or enters some words, reads some voices, provides some voices, and then the AI constructs the voice pattern of his AI, so it may be able to communicate with the robot through such a form, but in fact it is a mouse, the sound heard may be like his child, and the AI will be able to communicate with the robot through this form.",概念合成-功能,20
22,"But this feels a little bit weird, and the problem may be that this is not ethical, but what it is called, is probably a little bit scary, and it's not really scary. It's a little bit weird, I don't know what to say if it's a little bit like his kid is dead, but I don't know if this function is really more beneficial than harmful or more harmful than good.",基于功能的评估,21
23,"Hey, this article was actually just coming to him, when I thought about this feature I was thinking, hey, a lot of middle-aged and older people have some psychological problems, but they may not be willing to admit it, they may not be willing to face it, but hey, you can put some test questions in a conversation with him or say: hey, the two indicators are integrated into the conversation.",基于行为的先例,17
24,"If it is indeed a risky, high risk, then it may be possible to send this report to your children.",概念合成-行为,23
25,"If you can recognize this earlier, it will help you to do the following: treatment or rehabilitation.",基于行为的评估,24
26,"Life support can be a small thing, but it can help you accomplish something. It is more important than the elderly or the elderly because of the elderly.",基于功能的分析,2
27,"Oh, for example, faxing. Then what? What is it that older people shouldn't do?",概念合成-功能,26
28,"My uncle: ""Exceptional circumstances""  ""In an accident""  ""Oh, give a gift""  ""This may or may not be helpful?""",概念合成-功能,26
29,"Then if it falls? ──that's in that ──not called monitoring, not called detection, there may be some preconception ──that the whole environment can be controlled by the silicon sensor that may be passed through it.",概念合成-结构,28
30,"This feels like it's more in the UI, and there's some kind of need for the hardware that it supports. This in the heart, it's falling into the robot's lap, so this may need its form.",基于结构的分析,29
31,"I was wondering if it was possible to customize it? Customize it. ‒ The way you like it or the way your child looks. ‒ But here again, ‒ Avoid ‒ You don't. ‒ Because if it's someone you know, ‒ Well, that might be even more effective.",基于结构的分析,30;21
32,"And it would be strange if there were other options. Ah, just let him have more. It's always customized to make him more likeable, more accepting, oh, more open-hearted.",基于结构的评估,31
33,"I don't know how the assistive device is going to be integrated with the robot, but the idea is that if he really is integrated with him, the robot will also be able to act as a reminder or a message, like that smart medicine box.",概念合成-行为,30
34,"The idea of mental health is still pretty imaginative, because it seems that although it is not a lot of robots, but it is possible to refer to the feeling of accompanying children as a child, the needs of the elderly and children in this part of the world should have something in common.",基于行为的先例,17
35,"But the way to do it is to talk about the way he's a robot, first of all his appearance, then to make him easy to accept, then his voice.",基于结构的分析,34;32;21
36,"The subtle function is that these record his daily habits to remind him of these things, that he occasionally has conversations and communication and communication, and then to judge whether his emotions are not emotional states, mental states are healthy, need or not?",概念合成-行为,34
37,"This is a bit of a life robot, right? Well, even though it's also about appearance, it's not the most important thing to make it acceptable, but it's the most important thing to make it acceptable.",基于结构的评估,26
38,"What practical operations can help the elderly? Well, it will determine what its appearance will look like, that is, it may be a little more functional, then it will be. It will also need to have some more rich sensors, whether it is temperature, humidity, humidity, distance.",概念合成-结构,36
39,"Can you predict or perceive or predict some risk, say, gas gate something, and then feed back these in a voice way, or go directly to solve them, solve that problem.",概念合成-行为,38
40,"Well, I think, I think, if his purpose is so clear, then he could be a little doctor or a little nurse. That might be more convincing.",基于结构的评估,33
41,"Well, it's because I suddenly thought of a lot of people who might have high blood pressure, and that's probably the blood pressure.",基于功能的先例,1
42,"The blood pressure monitor, which is a tool for treating all kinds of diseases, and then including blood sugar tests, or high blood sugar, or insulin tests, and so on.",基于功能的先例,41
43,"If he says that this is a very separate program, not combined with the others, then he can do it. Oh, that's totally biased.",基于结构的分析,42;40
44,"It's the same as assembling parts. Oh, modular design should be modular design different parts of this whole robot, for example this person, he has a heart disease. Oh, he has high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood sugar, he could have this arm open on one side and it's a blood pressure machine, it's like a nurse yelling at him for measuring his blood pressure, but if he doesn't have this disease, then his arm can be equipped with other modules for other modules.",概念合成-结构,43
