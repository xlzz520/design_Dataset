1,The first thing that comes to mind is that the middle-aged people are the ones who are going to be the first to be in demand.,基于功能的分析,0
2,"Since the product is intended to accompany the health aspect, the first thing we want to know is: are middle-aged people in? physical health and mental health may be present in both?",基于功能的分析,1
3,"And then because first of all, considering that the robots they can provide are the companionship on the body and mind that is not very similar to what normal humans can provide, then you think about what they are different from humans. Maybe in function. What are the things that humans can't do and what are the things that humans can do but robots can't do.",基于功能的分析,2
4,"The middle-aged group has their own needs regarding physical health and mental health. Some accompanying needs, then physical health may be described as including physical decline or in some diseases.",基于功能的分析,2
5,"And then on a spiritual level, maybe it's accompaniment.",基于功能的分析,2
6,"Then he wants to make a healthy companion robot. He wants to give middle-aged people something that humans can't do. The first thing he might do is say, ""What do you think? It can. It can provide more comprehensive testing"". Then he wants to be able to be around middle-aged people all the time.",概念合成-行为,3
7,"Then there is the possibility that it could be able to provide some precise data, even calculations by artificial intelligence, to provide some precise needs that the individual needs.",概念合成-功能,4
8,"And if it is at the mental level, then the robot can't provide something like humans, for example, the emotional ones, the precise control or the ability to communicate with the elderly.",基于行为的分析,7
9,"One thing that comes to mind here is that middle-aged people, in fact, they will, and there may be some barriers to communication.",基于功能的先例,8
10,"Now I think that many robots he may have... are all in Mandarin or not? is more correct, or the conversation with the AI, maybe some comparison... accurate, then very correct language to communicate with the user, but for the middle-aged group, the words may be at the level of communication, for example, a lot.",基于行为的先例,9
11,"But for the middle-aged, it may be at the level of communication, for example, a lot. Many middle-aged people do not speak Mandarin well, and then maybe their ability to understand the language is limited.",基于功能的分析,10
12,"That word might be something that needs to be done for the robot to communicate. Something that needs to be done is to design specific functions. Say a dialect, and then train a language model that is more geared toward middle-aged communication.",概念合成-行为,10
13,"The word ""look"" is because I've seen some of the accompanying robots before, they may be more traditional ones, like the image of the machine, and then like the four-legged robot, which is, what?",基于结构的先例,6
14,The most shocking thing for middle-aged people is that they may be a little afraid to see something that is machine-like.,基于结构的评估,13
15,So it's a change from a machine form to a more soft mindset.,概念合成-结构,14
16,"Like the one that Japan had done before. The machine shape of a companion cat, it seems, is to make the shape into a fluffy texture, and then curl up in his arms like a cat.",基于结构的先例,15
17,"The functional structure above, as mentioned earlier, is: physical health is actually a more important aspect for the elderly. How should our robot guard some of the numerical data of his entire body or some of the testing points needed for his current disease?",基于功能的分析,7;13
18,And then we need to consider how our robots are supposed to do those things.,基于功能的分析,4;17
19,"And then the words, 'Because we're talking about the master or the companion, he can't just say it like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like a medical device, you can't be like",基于结构的先例,5
20,"So, from the perspective of companionship, it's a little more subtle, it's being able to hope for it to be more subtle, like a sensor and then a camera.",概念合成-结构,19
21,"Or from some more subtle interaction, like I can hold him, or from shaking hands with him and his mom and so on.",概念合成-行为,20
22,"And then, in addition to the possible care we provide, we provide some concrete help in the process of doing this health accompaniment, of course, in addition to monitoring.",基于功能的分析,21
23,"And then, in addition to the possible care that we can provide, we can also provide some specific help in the process of doing this healthcare, in addition to monitoring.",概念合成-行为,19
24,"The problem is that the robots are not able to help us in any way, and the robots are not able to help us in any way.",基于功能的评估,23
25,It may be a verbal reminder. Prepare some medicines or health care products that the elderly need to take regularly.,概念合成-功能,24
26,"And then maybe if you want to be a little bit more innovative, you just suddenly think, can you not make this robot into an adult?",基于结构的分析,25
27,"For example, he is a wheelchair, which he usually sits in. Or a massage chair. He is a piece of furniture. He is not a person or an animal.",概念合成-结构,19;23
28,"In this way, the kind of companionship it can provide is even stronger, which is that it is integrated into the lives of each of us.",基于结构的评估,27
29,"Then he would not have a sense of being either. This might be a comparative idea of a spacewalker, if it exists in the form of a chair or a wheelchair.",基于结构的评估,27
30,"And then on the mental level, in fact, in addition to communication, for example, we middle-aged people who usually want to do something when there is no one at home, for example, they may feel very empty or bored if they just sit there.",基于功能的先例,8
31,"For example, my own grandmother, he would normally cook, maybe in addition to grilling vegetables. In addition to doing housework, he would do that kind of small chore, like making a badge packaging, and then press the button, what is that kind of chore, and then how much time would he probably do?",基于功能的先例,30
32,"And then that word actually comes to the mind of an old man who doesn't need much money in return, but he may have that kind of give and take?",基于功能的分析,31
33,"And then the words, ""In the ordinary life"", are, ""Maybe there are middle-aged people who don't go out of their homes and do these things because there are risks involved, so if our product can give them this small share of the reward, then they will be able to do it"".",基于功能的评估,31
34,It might do something on the functional side. What about this? What is a game or what is it? Simulated operation etc.? Interactive interaction behavior?,概念合成-功能,33
35,"The robot is a robot that can be used to simulate the behavior of other robots, such as running.",概念合成-行为,34
36,"The middle-aged group. From this group, what we just talked about is the elderly. The elderly are the elderly in some empty nest that he may not have anyone in his home. But then in fact most of the cases are.",基于功能的先例,1
37,"I've done a similar thing before, I've seen a similar remote escort device, it's just that there's probably two of them separated by two places, but it can be done through some interaction on one side, and then some feedback on the other side, and then this word actually it's through this device to connect people to people.",基于行为的先例,36
38,"The device is not intended to provide emotional value to middle-aged people, but rather to provide them with something of value through the device itself.",基于行为的评估,37
39,"The device is more of a bridge in the middle; it may be that he is the one who takes the initiative, but he is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one",概念合成-行为,38
40,"Because many elderly people, they don't go out and seek some kind of emotional comfort or emotional value. Then this device would be more direct, then.",基于行为的评估,39
41,"And then I thought of one. We've done an instrument that looks like a weather sensor before, and it can go. The weather conditions on both sides of the connection.",基于行为的先例,38
42,"This is a way to let the other person know what the weather is like on your side, or even your mood, and then it's a way to convey your feelings in a subtle way.",基于行为的评估,41
43,"And then we'll probably summarize and summarize these products! First, it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then it's going to be one-on-one from a group perspective, and then",基于功能的评估,7;12;42
44,The first is about a robotic physiotherapist.,基于功能的分析,43
45,"The first is a robot that is about physiological health. Its shape. It may be a non-human shape. It is a piece of furniture or a wheelchair. It is a massage chair, wheelchair, etc. that is integrated into our everyday life.",概念合成-结构,27
46,"He can then give middle-aged people his own; that is, from monitoring to reminders to some physical accompaniment, some physical accompaniment!",概念合成-行为,23
47,"Yes, and then the second word is: ""The spirit accompanying you just mentioned"" which is that it is not a robot form, but a soft non-mechanical form, which is a kind of ""spirit accompanying"" that is not a robot form.",概念合成-结构,9
48,"It would then be able to weaken the robot's senses. Maybe not, maybe not at the level of language, maybe not at the level of language.",基于行为的先例,10
49,"The AI models we trained for, he doesn't understand very well. The way middle-aged people think or speak, we need to design more in line with them. The way they think and communicate. The dialects that might exist.",基于行为的分析,12
50,"And then the third thing that I just thought of was, first of all, he will act as a mediator, a bridge between the two, to help the elderly.",基于行为的评估,38
51,"As for its form, I think that... formally it can be a... that is, whether it is the weather or... anything in the environment.",概念合成-结构,41
52,"I just mentioned one more. Yeah, I forgot, it's about this mind-accompanying robot, which actually provides some communication from language. It actually provides some behavior. It provides some middle-aged people to participate in.",基于行为的分析,34
53,"Not only is it impossible, but it's not just a game or a simulation of a situation. If he can do the realism, the realism, our scenarios are probably going to be able to use some of these virtual reality technologies.",概念合成-行为,52
