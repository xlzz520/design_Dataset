4,"It's a companion robot, and I think that this function is probably monitoring is part of it, it's a little bit like that module design.",概念合成-结构,0;3
5,The old man takes it off every day and puts it on his hands. The robot senses something bad and runs past. I save him or say something. Give him a call.,概念合成-功能,4
6,He would run to the user every day and give him the bracelet.,概念合成-功能,5
7,"The bracelet can monitor his basic vital signs and life indicators, and also remind him.
