1,The first is aimed at the elderly who live in empty homes.,基于功能的分析,0
2,The old man who lives in an empty nest house is characterized by a certain degree of autonomy.,基于功能的先例,1
3,"If he is not able to move, then his ability to move is okay, so he should be more healthy and have some help with his diet.",基于功能的分析,2
4,"In addition to the traditional conversation or playback, like some music shows, radio shows, etc., the game is also available in a variety of formats.",基于功能的先例,3
5,"The time-based system is like a reminder to take a pill and then eat, which can be combined with, say, eating on time.",概念合成-功能,3;4
6,"Then include some reminders on cooking, cooking process or ingredient composition, and composition.",概念合成-功能,5
7,"Because the elderly, he might say his memory or his judgment about something, and after middle age, there might be some problems, but he's not going to be able to do that.",基于功能的先例,6
8,"The robot is largely a command, a warning and a reminder.",基于功能的分析,2
9,"The basic function of the database is to collect and analyze the data, and then to monitor the health of the population.",基于功能的先例,8
10,"So, for example, these physiological data, such as blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, etc., indicators of health, etc. Then there are some blood oxygen levels, etc. These are probably things that the elderly person needs to be concerned about.",概念合成-功能,2
11,"So, in addition to these types of monitoring, there are also: I think that the elderly person, although he has the ability to act independently, is actually some kind of auxiliary action, for example, helping the elderly person to observe the indoor and outdoor road conditions.",基于功能的分析,2
12,"In fact, the so-called road conditions are, for example, if there are some thresholds in the house or some table legs etc. these things will remind the elderly, and then it is outside, then it will also help the elderly to judge some conditions of some roads, and then it will be the same thing.",概念合成-功能,11
13,"I also thought of it as a function, like an auxiliary crutch.",概念合成-结构,12
14,"Even the use of a crutch, etc., is actually a way for older people to move around.",基于结构的评估,13
15,"The first is the use of the word ""fun"" in the name of entertainment.",基于功能的分析,2
16,"So for example: │ some chess, some chess game│ Oh, and then, the elderly program, the elderly program etc.│",基于功能的分析,16
17,"Then finally, there are some basic ones, such as communication functions.",基于功能的分析,2
18,"From the perspective of the child, to help, to remotely set up some remote system through some app or some Bluetooth connection with the robot.",概念合成-行为,17
19,"So, what about health monitoring? Specifically, it should be that the robot itself has some health monitoring modules, such as heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Some of these physiological data monitor blood oxygenation, which the elderly can easily and most conveniently do by contacting the corresponding functional module of the robot. Then complete the corresponding health function, and then upload the data to the platform and upload it to the app, through the children and say some private doctors or community doctors, they have a corresponding one such connection, that function is technically probably the most basic.",概念合成-行为,9
20,"They have a corresponding connection through their children and, say, some private doctors or community doctors, which is probably functionally what the basic thing is.",概念合成-功能,19
21,"There is an app, then there is the community, the nurses, the doctors etc. There is a connection.",概念合成-结构,20
22,"So, if you look at the basic, then further down the road, you see the road conditions, and so on, and then there are some corresponding visual layers, some functions of machine vision and it's implemented in terms of voice alerts, some ways of getting information out to the road, and then you see the way that the road conditions are being observed.",概念合成-结构,11
23,"The function of the assisting crutch may be to move the robot at the same frequency as the elderly, and then have a certain support function, or to move the robot in a motor form, to stabilize some of its movements, and then to carry weight etc.",基于行为的评估,14
24,"The entertainment function may be more virtual, such as a screen projection or a way to play chess with the elderly on his own screen.",概念合成-行为,15
25,"It's not like that works, it's like it's screen-based, and it's a little more feasible.",基于行为的评估,16;24
26,"So the most basic communication function, then some of the outsourced functions are like phone lookup video etc, then the custodial function it's probably more like consulting the camera, then being able to.",概念合成-行为,17
27,"The structural level. First of all, the basic movement robots are probably somewhat similar in their overall shape to the ones in hospitals, which are the ones that are upright and higher.",基于结构的先例,2
28,"But that word, actually, is that the kind of nurse robot in the hospital, since it also performs some functions, like delivering medication, it may have some requirements in terms of its volume, capacity, and the fact that it is not a robot that can be used for medical purposes.",基于结构的评估,27
29,"Then, if there is no requirement for this at home, the whole thing may be a little thinner and longer. Then, for the convenience of the elderly, for example, if you want to grab a crutch, it may have a more suitable handle on the head. Then, and that is, it may be slightly upright, but it is not easy to fall, but the whole thing may be a shape that is almost a meter or so high, and then the whole thing may be a little thinner.",概念合成-结构,2;28
30,"Then, because there are many other smart devices, it is possible that it is more concentrated in the corresponding positions of the product.",概念合成-结构,12;19;23
31,"If there is an innovative structure, I might choose some. If there is a structure, it might be combined with a product like a vacuum cleaner, so it might have another function, that is, it might be helping the elderly, and the end result is a cleanup in this room.",概念合成-结构,2
32,"The idea that I might have is that since this robot is already in this form, he might be doing some housecleaning while he's exercising, and then one of the functions that would further reduce the burden of living for the elderly is this big clean, yes, and also keep the indoor room clean, and that's a big part of the job.",基于结构的评估,31
33,"The second option, option two. Maybe this needle is for the elderly.",基于功能的分析,0
34,"So, in the context of the nursing home, the ability to move or live independently may be uneven, but the ability to live independently may be uneven.",基于功能的先例,33
35,"He may have something to build on the first option, like delivering medicine, delivering food, or even a new one.",概念合成-功能,34
36,"Because he may need one person to meet some needs of several elderly people at the same time, and then some for several elderly people. Medicated meals are taken. Targeted management is done.",基于功能的分析,34
37,The money can be used to make some interactions or accompany several elderly people at the same time.,基于功能的评估,36
38,"For example, if you add some entertainment functions, like elderly people, if you can middle-aged people, in a nursing home or in these kinds of healthcare environments, this robot can do a square dance, square dance song.",概念合成-功能,37
39,The screen is a bit bigger than it should be.,基于结构的评估,38
40,"Maybe more, then some companionship, maybe regularly, say regularly.",概念合成-功能,33
41,"There are also, for example, health records of the elderly. Here, it is likely that there are more systems-level designs, some system-functional designs.",概念合成-结构,40
42,"Then, compared to the previous version, it will have a little more structure overall, its storage space, its interactive screen. This aspect may be a little bigger than the version, because this is a wider range of use environment and people.",基于结构的评估,36;38
43,"It is possible that option 2 is an upgrade on the basis of option 1, and then more and more of a care system with a nursing home or a rehabilitation center such as a rehabilitation center, with some better connections, better systematic collection of monitoring data for the elderly such as health records, some management of daily living, etc.",基于功能的评估,41
44,"Then option three: ""How long is it now?"" 15 minutes? for the elderly in the park square. This is a health companion, because the elderly, perhaps middle-aged, will also appear in some outdoor recreation areas.",基于功能的分析,0
45,"So this kind of robot it may be more in the form of a public product, which is indeed in a relatively ideal state, and a state that may not be common in today's society. I I feel it is, in fact, for this kind of outdoor recreation place this kind of elderly companion.",概念合成-行为,44
46,"Some examples are the use of words like entertainment function or the playing of music like the previous one, the playback of a square dance song.",概念合成-功能,45;38
47,"Then there are the patrols, the monitoring, the safety of the elderly, the first aid equipment, the medicines, the emergency call, the timely treatment of the elderly in the face of an outdoor emergency.",概念合成-功能,46
48,"The timely remedy may be the robot in this public setting, some of whose role is to help the poor and the needy.",基于功能的评估,47
49,"Then there are some connections with community hospitals, what police station, this fire station, etc. Then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, and then there are some, but this is probably just a precaution, and so on.",概念合成-功能,47
50,"In addition to the entertainment function. Then there may be more to do with the health monitoring, security and some handling of some of the emergencies in the environment as a whole, which I think this type of robot might be able to do.",基于功能的评估,48;49
51,"So it could be the shape of the two main ones upstairs, or maybe it could be a humanoid.",基于结构的分析,50
52,"Some of the innovations in its structure may be in the outdoor environment, it may be that there are steps and slopes, what kind of different road conditions, what kind of road conditions, and what kind of road conditions.",基于结构的分析,51
53,"The robot may have some better features in its movement structure, its motor drive structure. The design is to be able to accommodate different road conditions, making the robot better able to move, and the design is to be able to move around in a different way.",概念合成-结构,44
54,"This is what I think is going to be more complicated for this robot, its movement environment or one of its work environments, than the previous two.",基于行为的评估,33;2;53
55,"Of course, these are not the same as the two robots before, he could be a charger.",基于结构的先例,35;46
56,"So this outdoor word, then it itself. To increase the durability, maybe the durability problem, it might be combined. This solar charging might be even more.",概念合成-结构,52;53
57,"So, what is the fourth option? What is the middle-aged health companion robot?",基于功能的分析,0
58,"So this family model is actually having children, having a caregiver, in the context of a family environment where there are multiple members, then this type of robot might have a function that I think would be simplified a little bit, but it's not a simple one.",基于功能的分析,57
59,"I feel more inclined towards a sort of desktop robot even if the Bluetooth speakers are the kind of thing that they don't have the ability to move, maybe it's more at the bedside of the elderly, or the desk, etc. These places might be more like entertainment rooms, one by one, for entertainment purposes, and the other is the one where the elderly are more likely to be in the same room.",概念合成-结构,58
60,"The first is that the diet, then the medication, then some of the basic physiological symptoms, the monitoring of these aspects of the memory, the monitoring of the memory, the monitoring of the memory, the monitoring of the memory, the monitoring of the memory, the monitoring of the memory.",概念合成-功能,59;6;8;35
61,"So a government robot like this, his job might be lighter, and then at the same time maybe he'll have to use... maybe he'll have some entertainment, maybe some better interaction, maybe some homework, maybe some voice communication, maybe some intelligence.",概念合成-行为,59;60
62,"The same is true for the other two, except that this robot is smaller, has no mobility requirements, and does not need to have too much capacity to do better, some of which is interactive, and some of which is data monitoring and control.",基于结构的评估,59;61
63,"Option 5 may be that you need to further refine the population. For example, ""serious"". For example, ""serious ward"".",基于功能的分析,0
64,"Then we have option six, option six is ◎ option six‬ sometimes wheelchair‬",概念合成-结构,0
65,"The term ""Self-care"" is used to describe the process of the elderly losing their autonomy, and the ability to move and care for themselves. In the case of the elderly, the role of the care is more to help the child or other caregiver to better fulfill a concern for the elderly, and to help the elderly to be more aware of their needs.",基于功能的分析,64
66,"My understanding is that it also doesn't require mobility, but rather is more about image collection with a data collection, combined with artificial intelligence and some features to do better to care for the elderly to further remind caregivers to do more timely and accurate things for the elderly.",概念合成-功能,65
67,"It doesn't have to be a robot, it can be a bunch of cameras, or sensors, or even a bunch of modular devices that aren't integrated, and then some sort of processing system that is integrated into the so-called robot's core, and so on.",概念合成-结构,66
68,"I think it's possible that in this form, rather than the traditional robot form, the robot will be able to do this.",基于结构的评估,67
69,"It's more like having an intelligent robot brain, and then, well, there's this multi-modular surveillance device, the surveillance module, in this form that exists in this ward or this old man who is paralyzed.",概念合成-结构,68
70,"Then there's the part that might have been thinking about a wheelchair, which is an elderly person whose way of acting is a wheelchair. So this robot could be?",概念合成-结构,64
71,"It may be that it is installed on a wheelchair, and then on the one hand it may be an assisted-assisted movement.",基于结构的评估,68
72,"In fact, the old man, he doesn't even call it a wheelchair, he has an electric car, in fact, I've seen it just use his finger to swing the swing, and then there's some buttons like that, going back and forth, it's an electric wheelchair.",基于结构的先例,71
73,"Then maybe such a robot it is combined in this wheelchair afterwards, it can help the elderly better to judge the road conditions, better to go to mobile control speed etc, and then build a combination of a safe driving, then have a better judgment for the road conditions, then have corresponding, such as positioning, this reminder of the route, then then some basic some contact function, call for help function.",概念合成-功能,72
74,The report also highlights the need for a more effective approach to the issue of elderly people.,基于功能的评估,73
75,"It could be something like a smart smart wheelchair, a smart wheelchair car that combines a concept like robots and a wheelchair, and it could be a smart wheelchair.",基于结构的先例,74
76,"So I think if it's a little bit high-end, it's just going to be shaping the robot into a wheelchair, or directly combining the shape of the wheelchair car. If it's a little bit cheaper, maybe a little bit more harmonious, it's going to be assembled into an existing wheelchair.",概念合成-结构,75;67
77,"So the two types of it have two different structures, so the first is that it's completely necessary to design a new smart wheelchair car, and the other is that it might be some modular components that are installed on the wheels, the handles, or the dashboard, etc. in these places, and then implement its corresponding functions.",基于结构的评估,76
